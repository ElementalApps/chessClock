# chessClock
Expo project

Made with Expo (React Native).


Done:

* Clock runs
* Possible to pause
* Possible to restart the clock with previous time
* Possible to set run time same to both clocks (only in minutes)

To do:

* Make setting time more flexible (add seconds, add different times for players)
* Add optional increment time functionality
* Style the whole app
